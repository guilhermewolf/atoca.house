# This setup is not safe for production because the proxy will self-sign its certificate.
# Use those values for testing only

# The chart should deploy and work only with a clusterName.
# This setup can also cause redirection issues if the proxy is contacted with a hostName instead of an IP address
# as it is not aware of its external hostname and will attempt to perform a redirection.
