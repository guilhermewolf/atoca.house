## A Toca - K8s

My _Personal_ Kubernetes GitOps Repository

_... managed with ArgoCD and GitHub Actions_

</div>

---

## üìñ Overview

This is a mono repository for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using the tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

---

### Installation

My cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned overtop bare-metal Ubuntu 22 using the [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup). This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for (NFS) file storage.

---

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): self-hosted Github runners
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): automatically syncs DNS records from my cluster ingresses to a DNS provider
- [1Password Controler](https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-operator): Secrets storage using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer
- [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/): GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes
- [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/): load balancer for bare metal Kubernetes clusters
- [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/): distributed block storage for Kubernetes
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): monitoring and alerting toolkit
- [Cloudfrare-Controler](https://github.com/adyanth/cloudflare-operator): External tunnel for exposing services on my cluster to the internet

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are selfhosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

| Service                                         | Use                                                               | Cost           |
